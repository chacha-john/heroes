# Description
<p>This application allows you to 
  * Recruit a well-balanced team of superheroes (or any other character-type of your choosing).
  * Create a Hero object: At the very least, they should have a name, age, special power and weakness.Special powers and weaknesses could be freely assignable or you may offer users a pre-determined set to choose from.
  * Create a Squad object: They should have a max size, name, and a cause they're are dedicated to fighting (sexism, computer illiteracy, not covering your mouth when you sneeze, hogging bus seats with your backpack, passive-aggressive post-it notes, etc). 
  * Allow users to assign Heros to a Squad.
      * Each hero can only participate in one Squad at a time.
      * You could even calculate scores for a specific skill area for your squad (defense, distance attacks, etc), or begin to integrate a turn-based battle system.</p>
